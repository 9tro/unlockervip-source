# The Story

This guy comes in my dm's saying that he'll sell me the source of this tool for $50. I didn't want it to begin with, but I went with it.

We talked for a little bit more and he sent me this garbage looking login screen for the tool.

Ok... So now I wanted this tool, but not because I wanted to buy it.

I set out on asking his customers to send me the file and guess what, one of them did. He told me that I probably wouldn't want it anyways because it's terrible and hasn't been working

Doesn't matter...still wanted it.

Ended up cracking it in like 1 minute lol

yuh. that's it ig. He banned me from the server and everything lol. told me to get a life and that he was just tryna make some money and i was jealous.

his customers said the tool is garbage anyways. that's why the customer gave me the download in the first place
